# QC QuickCheck

*Quick Check of Cisco CE endpoints info*

---

## Motivation

There are many fine tools for managing Cisco Video Endpoints that do so much more than **QuickCheck**.  But, on occasion, you get a call saying "All the video units are down." Are they?  Are they ALL down or just some of them?  With QuickCheck, you could query the QC bot in a webex teams space with "QC getStatus" and the bot would query the status of every video unit you manage and respond with a quick, concise report right back to you in the same Webex Teams space. Maybe follow that with "QC getDiags" to see a report of current Diagnostic Alerts generated by each of your managed endpoints.  Quick and Simple with valuable results.

## Show Me!

Are all my endpoints running the same code?  Use QuickCheck!

## Installation

Provide a step-by-step series of examples and explanations for how to install your project and its dependencies.

This code is written for **Python 3**... if you have a Mac, it comes with **Python 2**... you will need to upgrade to Python 3 or do a whole lot of changes to many of the methods for it to work.

###Pre-Requisites for QuickCheck###
  - Create a webex teams bot - I created QC@webex.bot
      How to create a webex teams bot (using python):
  https://developer.webex.com/blog/spark-bot-demo
  - Invite your bot to a webex teams space
  - Create a webex teams webhook that will listen for messages to your bot and forward them to a public address for your bot handling app.(this app)
    HowTo:
  - Get an account on ngrok which gives you a tunnel from ngrok to your laptop and a public address at ngrok for your webhook to send http messages to.  *** ngrok is sometimes considered a security risk by corporate security services, so check with IT before loading ngrok client on your laptop.
    - Launch ngrok client on laptop
- Edit endpoints.json file to include endpoints you want to manage.
- Run main.py from terminal on laptop
    main.py will
      - launch local HTTP server on port 10010
        (You can change port number in main.py/global variables)
      - check your local ngrok client and get public uri
      - edit your webex teams webhook with current ngrok target
