# QC QuickCheck

*Quick Check of Cisco CE endpoints info*

---

**ToDo's:**

- [ ] Consider writing your README first.  Doing so helps you clarify your intent, focuses your project, and it is much more fun to write documentation at the beginning of a project than at the end of one, see:
    - [Readme Driven Development](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html)
    - [GitHub Guides: Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [ ] Ensure you put the [license and copyright header](./HEADER) at the top of all your source code files.
- [ ] Be mindful of the third-party materials you use and ensure you follow Cisco's policies for creating and sharing Cisco Sample Code.

## Motivation

There are many fine tools for managing Cisco Video Endpoints that do so much more than **QuickCheck**.  But, on occasion, you get a call saying "All the video units are down." Are they?  Are they ALL down or just some of them?  With QuickCheck, you could query the QC bot in a webex teams space "QC getStatus" and the bot would query the status of every video unit you manage and respond with a quick, concise report. Maybe follow that with "QC getDiags" to see a report of Diagnostic Alerts generated by each of your managed endpoints.  Quick and Simple with valuable results.

## Show Me!

Are all my endpoints running the same code?  Use QuickCheck!

Pre-Requisites for QuickCheck
  - Create a webex teams bot - I created QC@webex.bot
      How to create a webex teams bot (using python):
  https://developer.webex.com/blog/spark-bot-demo
  - Invite your bot to a webex teams space
  - Create a webex teams webhook that will listen for messages to your bot and forward them to your bot handling app. (this app)
    HowTo:
  - Get an account on ngrok which gives you a tunnel from ngrok to your laptop and a public address at ngrok for your webhook to send http messages to.  *** ngrok is sometimes considered a security risk by corporate security services, so check with IT before loading ngrok client on your laptop.
    - Launch ngrok client on laptop
- Edit endpoints.json file to include endpoints you want to manage.
- Run main.py from terminal on laptop
    main.py will
      - launch local HTTP server on port 10010
        (You can change port number in main.py/global variables)
      - check your local ngrok client and get public uri
      - edit your webex teams webhook with current ngrok target
